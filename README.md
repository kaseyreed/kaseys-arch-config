# TODO:

- [x] Part 1: Much better sxhkdrc config (think macos inspiried... i hate that fucking win key)
- [x] System Notifications (dunt already installed.)
- [ ] conky
- [ ] Lightdm Config (or maybe I just get rid of this entirely...)
- [ ] Grub Config and theming
- [ ] Setup zinit and zsh and terminal
- [ ] Drop down terminal? Might have an easier way to do this with bspwm
- [ ] Setup git configuration for personal github
- [ ] Part 2: Even better sxhdrc.

## General System Cleanup
- [ ] make install artifacts
- [ ] old themes, wallpapers we aren't going to use

## Things to Install
- [ ] IntellJ + Products

## Bugs
* Firefox window opens terribly sometimes
* Every so often light dm fails to start, likley a race condition with the video card driver init.
